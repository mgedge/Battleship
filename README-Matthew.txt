Project Instructions: 
The project is a game similar to the game 'Battleship'. Players alternate taking shots at a 
board until all ships are destroyed. In our version, we implemented an AI system so that 1 
person can play by themself, or watch two AI go against each other. Players can place a total
of 7 ships on a board using the joystick. After the ships are placed, players will take shots
on their opponent's board until one player has no ships remaining. The game ends and allows 
the player to choose to play again. In the future, I would like to make the AI smarter, 
placing ships at locations humans are statistically less likely to shoot at, and shooting at
places where humans statistically place their ships. In addition, I would like to make the
ships larger, so that strategy can be a factor in the game, rather than lucky guessing.

My role in the project: 
In this project, I primarily wrote the logic of the game. I initially
wrote the game logic in Java, a language I am much more familiar with. I continuously added
features after I got each partdone. I worked on a little bit of the graphics and debugging.

Workload Breakdown: 
I found that I wrote the logic for this project.  I just wrote the entire 
program before the first day of the project. Then after I wrote the program, I kept adding 
more features. In class, I had Rob convert the Java code I wrote into C, something that 
definitely saved time. In addition, he worked on the Powerpoint presentation and testing. 
Overall, I think the ratio of work done was probably around 50/50.

What I learned from the project: 
In this project, I learned about C and the importance of  getting functionality finished 
before debugging. While writing the code for the project, I was so focused on fixing every 
bug that I wasn't even getting the game itself done. I stopped trying to fix every bug and 
instead just got the game to work, then I got to debugging. When I switch from debugging to 
just finishing the game, I started to save a lot of time and focus on what's most important:
getting something that at least works.

Suggestions: 
I think one of the biggest obstacles for this project, was that I was unfamiliar
with C. I wrote the program in Java and had to figure out how to translate it into C, which
took up a ton of time. I think in the future, C should be taught in the beginning of the 
class, or at least make learning C early in the class a priority for the students.
